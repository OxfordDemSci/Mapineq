# MapIneq API (v1)

The MapIneq project compiles, curates, and distributes a unique open-access 
inequality database containing policy, environmental factors, and social 
indicators of opportunities and outcomes across the life course. This API 
provides programmatic access to query the database to extract subsets of 
information based on spatial or other characteristics of the data.

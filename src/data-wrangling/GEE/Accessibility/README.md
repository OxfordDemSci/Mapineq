## 2. Processing Methodology

The analysis used Google Earth Engine (GEE) to process WorldClim bioclimatic and climatology data. For each geographical unit (NUTS, ITL, or EURO regions), all values from the selected bands were extracted, and summary metrics were computed to describe climatic patterns within each region. Metrics included mean, minimum, maximum, median, standard deviation, and key percentiles (10th, 25th, 75th, 90th), providing a comprehensive overview of spatial variability.

2. **Processing Method**

- **Code Links:**  
  - [GEE-WC_Bio](https://github.com/OxfordDemSci/Mapineq/blob/208-gee-sub-worldclim/src/data-wrangling/GEE/WorldClim/WC_Bio.js)  
  - [Post_GEE](https://github.com/OxfordDemSci/Mapineq/blob/208-gee-sub-worldclim/src/data-wrangling/GEE/WorldClim/GEE_WC.ipynb)  
- **Metrics Explanation:**  
Calculated metrics for each region (NUTS, ITL, EURO) are derived from the `accessibility` band of the accessibility_to_cities_2015_v1_0 data.  The calculated statistical metrics are summarised below:  
    - Mean (`mean`): Average value across all pixels within the polygon  
    - Minimum (`min`): Lowest value within the polygon  
    - Maximum (`max`): Highest value within the polygon  
    - Median (`median`): Middle value within the polygon  
    - Standard Deviation (`stdDev`): Variation of values within the polygon  

- **Shapefile Used:** NUTS, ITL, EURO
